# OOK (ONS trade search)

## Set-up

For connecting to the cogs-staging drafter endpoint (i.e. for ETL), you'll need to set the secret key for the [ook application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/eu/swirrl-staging/applications/br25ZFYNX0wHK3z7FIql2mK91z8ZZcC8). You can configure the `AUTH0_SECRET` environmental variable, or create an encrypted file with this as it's contents:

```bash
echo VALUE_OF_THE_SECRET | gpg -e -r YOUR_PGP_ID > resources/secrets/AUTH0_SECRET.gpg
```

You can use this pattern and the `ook.concerns.integrant/secret` reader to encrypt other secrets.

## Running the project

### Server

Start a repl with the dev alias (using e.g. `bin/repl` or however you normally do) and run:

```clojure
(dev)
(go)
```

Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser (or whatever port you set if you overwrite it in `env/dev/resources/local.edn`).

### Clojurescript

If you don't have a recent version of the Yarn package manager installed, get it [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

From the root directory of the project install JS dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then compile the cljs to JS and watch for changes:
```bash
yarn  watch
```

or, if you also want the devcards:
```bash
yarn watch-all
```

With the shadow-cljs watcher running, devcards are available at `localhost:8000`.

## Testing

Run the tests with the alias:

```bash
clojure -A:test
```
